The calculations shown here were used to model the twinning re-orientation in the manuscript entitled:

**" On the Observation of Annealing Twins during Simulating Î²-grain Refinement in Ti-6Al-4V High Deposition Rate AM with In-Process Deformation "**

by "J. Donoghue, A. E. Davis, C. S. Daniel, A. Garner, F. Martina, J. Quinta Da Fonseca, and P. B. Prangnell"

The reorientation caused by twinning is modeled as a rotation by $60^\circ$ about $<1\, 1\, 1\,>$. This is implemented using quaternion algebra.
